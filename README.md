# 🚦 PrePlanGo – Smarter Commutes. On Time. Every Time. 🚗

### 🧠 Problem
People waste hours stuck in traffic due to unpredictable congestion.  
Current navigation tools (like Google Maps) only show **real-time traffic**, not **future congestion patterns**.

---

### 💡 Solution
**PrePlanGo** is an AI-powered traffic predictor that combines  
🚗 **Historical traffic**, 🌦️ **Weather**, 🗓️ **Events & holidays**, and 🧠 **Predictive modeling**  
to forecast **future congestion levels**, **travel times (ETA)**, and **optimal departure times** —  
helping users plan smarter and arrive on time, every time.

---

### ✨ Key Features
- 🔮 Predicts **congestion level** → Low / Medium / High  
- ⏰ Suggests **best departure time** for your desired arrival  
- 🧭 Shows **route preview** with embedded **dynamic map**  
- 🧠 “What-if Mode” → simulate different times/weather scenarios  
- 🚦 Compare **alternate routes** with predicted ETAs  
- 🔔 Push notifications → “Leave in 20 mins to avoid 30-min delay”
